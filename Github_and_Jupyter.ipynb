    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "- because files go through many versions and we need a way to track changes and go back to previous versions\n",

    "- version control allows many people to work in parallel\n",

    "- version history in Dropbox\n",
    "- version history in Github\n",
    "    - version control and better at handling conflicting changes\n",
    "\n",
    "How?\n",
    "- Version control systems start with a base version of the document and then record changes you make each step of the way.\n",
    "- Changes tracked are associated with files in a Github repository\n",
